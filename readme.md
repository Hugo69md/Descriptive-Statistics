# Inferential Statistics Project

A comprehensive Python project for statistical analysis, featuring various graphs and data analysis tools.

## 📊 Data Sources / filtering 

This script only handles CSV but you can modify it to access .parquet or any other extension, in the analysis.py file

To change to dataset to analyse : 
- put your CSV file in the root of your project
- go to utils > analysis > analysis.py
- change the name in brackets in LINE 6, to match your file to analyse 

Your data will now be the source of future analysis !

To apply filters to you dataset :
- go to utils > __dfmodification > dfmodif.py
- using pandas, you can apply filters to your data, small examples are available in the provided dfmodif file

Your data is now filtered ! enjoy your graphs !

## 📦 Required Libraries

Before running this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **seaborn** - Statistical data visualization
- **matplotlib** - Plotting and visualization
- **numpy** - Numerical computing
- **sklearn** - For linear regression

### Installation

You can install all required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scipy numpy sklearn
```

Or if you're using a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scipy numpy sklearn
```

## 🚀 How to Run

To execute the main program, Make sure you're in the project root directory when running this command.

```bash
python3 main.py
```
let the console guide you into what you want to do with the script !
